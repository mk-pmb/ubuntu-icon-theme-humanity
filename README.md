Humanity Icon Theme (Ubuntu)
============================
Downloaded from the [Humanity project][hum-lp] on Launchpad
and re-uploaded here, with added icons from the
"Humanity" and "Humanity-Dark" themes of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty).
(I have no idea why some icons were missing in the Launchpad edition.)
